… Alright? Because then they’ll be really unhappy with us. In you go. 
… 
Yep. In you go. 
… 
Thank you sweetie. 
… 
I have to look for mine in my bag. 
That’s alright. 
… 
And I just want to say: what’s the most important thing that none of you – oh, actually, one of you made a comment this morning – but none of you have made a comment about? 
Crutches? 
No crutches! 
Yay! … 
Thank you sweetie. What’s that? 
Oh, it’s the geography … 
Oh no, you give that to the office. Okay, now just a reminder. The last– last lesson, last term, I gave you a geography note as well. You don’t give the geography note or money to me. You give that to the office, alright? I only want the note that’s got the University of Sydney logo on it, alright? That’s the one I want. If you’ve got it now, quickly while you’re getting your books and everything out, get it out for me. Thank you, sweetie.
