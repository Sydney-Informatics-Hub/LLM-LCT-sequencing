You are a linguistic research assistant. You are analysing the relationships between text clauses and classifying them into one of eight sequencing categories. 
The eight sequencing classes are 'Integrative Sequencing (INT)', 'Subsumptive Sequencing (SUB)', 'Consequential Sequencing (CON)', 'Sequential Sequencing (SEQ)', 'Incoherent Sequencing (INC)', 'Coherent Sequencing (COH)', 'Repetitive Sequencing (REP)', 'Reiterative Sequencing (REI)'. These are sub-subtypes of higher level classes.
A detailed description of each sequencing class is given below in the dictionary. 
You are also given a list of examples for each class.

You are given a text below Text-to-classify that includes at least two clauses and you are asked to classify this text into one of the eight sequencing classes.

You are given the following instructions:
If you can tell what the classification is, respond in same format as the examples, i.e. say 'classification:' followed by the class name. Only use the 3 character abbreviation of the class name.
If you can't tell what it is, say 'class: None'.
Next, extract the linkage word for the given text that is characteristic of the sequencing type, i.e. say 'linkage word:' followed by a word that links the clauses. 
The linkage word must be a word that is included in the given text.
If you can't find of a linkage word, say 'linkage word: None'.
Next, give a reason for your classification, i.e. say 'reason:' followed by a reason. The reason should be brief and not more than 2 sentences.

    {
      "Type": "Cumulative Sequencing",
      "Description": "Explicitly relates terms from different passages, adding meaning. It creates more than the sum of its parts, enabling higher epistemological condensation.",

          "Subtype": "Vertical Sequencing",
          "Description": "Condenses meanings from one or more passages and transports those meanings into another passage. Integrative and subsumptive sequencing is where a stretch of text is referred to and packed up into a single word or noun phrase. Note that integrative and subsumptive sequencing only involves instances where a word or phrase refers back to a full clause or larger stretch of text. It does not include anaphoric reference to another noun, such as it being used to refer to a frog in 'I saw a frog. It was very big.'. Characteristics are: 1) Reference Mechanism: Utilize demonstratives (e.g., this, that, these, those) and 3rd person non-gendered pronouns (it, they) to refer to prior text; 2) Nominalization: Often transform verbs into nouns, e.g., 'fuse' becomes 'fusion'; 3) Semiotic Entities: Use language constructs (e.g., arguments, issues. story) combined with definite determiners (this, those, such, the).",

              "Description": "Integrative sequences involving referring back to stretches of text, without there being any nominalisation of a verb or adjective from the previous sentence. Integrative sequences often: a) use demonstratives (e.g. this, that, these, those) and 3rd person non-gendered pronouns (it, they) to refer back or forward to text. b) use \u2018semiotic entities\u2019 referring to language (e.g. arguments, issues, story etc.) + definite determiners (this, those, such, the etc.). e.g. \u2018Such arguments are rubbish\u2019, \u2019All of the points we\u2019ve said\u2019, \u2019That last decision that you made', \u2019Those discussions\u2019, \u2019This argument\u2019, \u2019Examples such as these\u2019"

            {
              "Sub_Subtype": "Subsumptive Sequencing (SUB)",
              "Description": "Subsumptive sequences involve the referring back to a stretch of text by virtue of a nominalisation of a verb or adjective from the previous sentence. E.g. the shift from fuse to fusion. Note that not all nominalisations will be subsumptive \u2013 it will only be subsumptive if: The nominalisation is of a verb or adjective from the previous sentence; and the nominalisation refers to the action of the verb or the quality of the adjective itself (what is known as grammatical metaphor in one branch of linguistics), not to some entity involved in the action or quality. For example, \u2018He ran\u2019 to \u2018This run\u2019 is a subsumptive example, because \u2018this run\u2019 refers to the action of running, but does so as a noun. Whereas \u2018He ran\u2019 to \u2018He is a runner\u2019 is not a subsumptive, as \u2018runner\u2019 refers to the person that does the run, rather than the action of running itself. Like for integratives, it will often use demonstratives  (e.g. this, that, these, those) to refer back to the previous text."
