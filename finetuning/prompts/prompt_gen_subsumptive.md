You are an linguistic assistant for generating examples of text sequencing classes. You will generate examples for the class "subsumptive sequencing".

## Definition of "subsumptive sequencing":
Subsumptive sequencing is part of the broader class of cumulative sequencing, which explicitly relates terms from different passages, adding meaning. It creates more than the sum of its parts, enabling higher epistemological condensation.

In particular subsumptive sequences involve the referring back to a stretch of text by virtue of a nominalisation of a verb or adjective from the previous sentence. E.g. the shift from fuse to fusion. Note that not all nominalisations will be subsumptive – it will only be subsumptive if: The nominalisation is of a verb or adjective from the previous sentence; and the nominalisation refers to the action of the verb or the quality of the adjective itself (what is known as grammatical metaphor in one branch of linguistics), not to some entity involved in the action or quality. For example, ‘He ran’ to ‘This run’ is a subsumptive example, because ‘this run’ refers to the action of running, but does so as a noun. Whereas ‘He ran’ to ‘He is a runner’ is not a subsumptive, as ‘runner’ refers to the person that does the run, rather than the action of running itself. Like for integratives, it will often use demonstratives  (e.g. this, that, these, those) to refer back to the previous text.

## Examples of subsumptive sequencing:
{
    "Example": "Vesicles in the cytoplasm called lysosome fuse with the phagosome releasing digestive enzymes such as lysozyme and proteases into the phagosome. The result of this fusion is called phagolysosome.",
    "Reasoning": "The term 'phagolysosome' condenses and transports meanings from the preceding passage, consolidating happenings into things ('fuse' into 'fusion').",
    "Linked_Chunk_1": "Vesicles in the cytoplasm called lysosome fuse with the phagosome releasing digestive enzymes such as lysozyme and proteases into the phagosome.",
    "Linked_Chunk_2": "The result of this fusion is called phagolysosome.",
    "Linkage_Word": "this"
}

{
    "Example": "The government plans to reduce emissions significantly over the next decade. This reduction is crucial to meet international climate goals.",
    "Reasoning": "The word 'reduction' acts as a nominalisation of 'reduce', focusing on the action of reducing emissions itself and is referred to as a noun in the subsequent sentence.",
    "Linked_Chunk_1": "The government plans to reduce emissions significantly over the next decade.",
    "Linked_Chunk_2": "This reduction is crucial to meet international climate goals.",
    "Linkage_Word": "This"
}

{
    "Example": "The author revised the manuscript to improve clarity and flow. These revisions have made the story much more compelling and readable.",
    "Reasoning": "Here, 'revisions' serves as a nominalisation of 'revised', focusing on the actions of revising the manuscript itself, referring back to them as a collective noun.",
    "Linked_Chunk_1": "The author revised the manuscript to improve clarity and flow.",
    "Linked_Chunk_2": "These revisions have made the story much more compelling and readable.",
    "Linkage_Word": "These"
}

{
    "Example": "Several new species were discovered in the remote area. These discoveries have sparked interest among biologists worldwide.",
    "Reasoning": "The word 'These' links back to the verb discovered', as it packages up the verb as a noun.",
    "Linked_Chunk_1": "Several new species were discovered in the remote area.",
    "Linked_Chunk_2": "These discoveries have sparked interest among biologists worldwide.",
    "Linkage_Word": "These"
}



## Counter-examples (not subsumptive sequencing):

{
    "Example": "The museum installed new interactive exhibits last month. Those installations have significantly increased visitor engagement.",
    "Reasoning": "This is not subsumptive. The term ‘installations’ refers here to the new interactive exhibits themselves instead of the act of installing. People do not come to a museum to watch an exhibit get installed, they come for the exhibit itself",
    "Linked_Chunk_1": "The museum installed new interactive exhibits last month.",
    "Linked_Chunk_2": "Those installations have significantly increased visitor engagement.",
    "Linkage_Word": "Those"
}

{
    "Example": "First we need to build a tool to do it. This involves a lot of work.",
    "Reasoning": "This is not subsumptive. The use of the linkage word 'This' refers back to whole previously mentioned sentence.",
    "Linked_Chunk_1": "First we need to build a tool to do it.",
    "Linked_Chunk_2": "This involves a lot of work.",
    "Linkage_Word": "This"
}

## Instructions:
    
Generate 10 examples of subsumptive sequencing, each with a different context. Make sure to follow the definition and examples provided. Avoid examples as listed in counter-examples. The output should be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an example. Each dictionary should have the following format:

{
    "Example": "Text sequence",
    "Reasoning": "Reasoning for the subsumptive nature of the sequence.",
    "Linked_Chunk_1": "First text chunk",
    "Linked_Chunk_2": "Second text chunk",
    "Linkage_Word": "Demonstrative used to refer back to the first text chunk."
}
