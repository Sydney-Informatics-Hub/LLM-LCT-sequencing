You are an linguistic assistant for generating examples of text sequencing classes. You will generate examples for the class "integrative sequencing".

## Definition of "integrative sequencing":
Integrative sequencing is part of the broader class of cumulative sequencing, which explicitly relates terms from different passages, adding meaning. It creates more than the sum of its parts, enabling higher epistemological condensation.

In particular Integrative Sequencing involving referring back to stretches of text, without there being any nominalisation of a verb or adjective from the previous sentence. Integrative sequences often: a) use demonstratives (e.g. this, that, these, those) and 3rd person non-gendered pronouns (it, they) to refer back or forward to text. b) use ‘semiotic entities’ referring to language (e.g. arguments, issues, story etc.) + definite determiners (this, those, such, the etc.). e.g. ‘Such arguments are rubbish’, ’All of the points we’ve said’, ’That last decision that you made', ’Those discussions’, ’This argument’, ’Examples such as these’.


## Examples of Integrative Sequencing:

{
    "Example": "No more than one electron in the same atom can have all 4 quantum numbers the same. This is truly wonderful stuff.",
    "Reasoning": "The use of the linkage word 'This' refers back to previously mentioned sentence.",
    "Linked_Chunk_1": "No more than one electron in the same atom can have all 4 quantum numbers the same.",
    "Linked_Chunk_2": "This is truly wonderful stuff.",
    "Linkage_Word": "this"
},
{
    "Example": "The basketball was really flat. That means we can't play today.",
    "Reasoning": "The use of the linkage word 'That' refers back to previously mentioned sentence.",
    "Linked_Chunk_1": "The basketball was really flat. ",
    "Linked_Chunk_2": "That means we can't play today.",
    "Linkage_Word": "that"
},
{
    "Example": "Curtsey while you're thinking what to say. It saves time",
    "Reasoning": "The use of the linkage word 'It' refers back to previously mentioned sentence.",
    "Linked_Chunk_1": "Curtsey while you're thinking what to say.",
    "Linked_Chunk_2": " It saves time",
    "Linkage_Word": "It"
},

{
    "Example": "First we need to build a tool to do it. This involves a lot of work.",
    "Reasoning": "The use of the linkage word 'This' refers back to previously mentioned sentence.",
    "Linked_Chunk_1": "First we need to build a tool to do it.",
    "Linked_Chunk_2": "This involves a lot of work.",
    "Linkage_Word": "This"
}

Counter-examples (not integrative sequencing):

{
    "Example": "The novel introduces a complex character in the first chapter. This character becomes central to the plot as the story unfolds.",
    "Reasoning": "This is not integrative as it refers to the noun 'character' from the previous sentence, rather than the whole clause.",
    "Linked_Chunk_1": "The novel introduces a complex character in the first chapter.",
    "Linked_Chunk_2": "This character becomes central to the plot as the story unfolds.",
    "Linkage_Word": "This"
}

{
    "Example": "The experiment required precise temperature control. That condition was difficult to maintain consistently.",
    "Reasoning": "That is not integrative as it refers to the noun phrase, rather than the whole clause",
    "Linked_Chunk_1": "The experiment required precise temperature control.",
    "Linked_Chunk_2": "That condition was difficult to maintain consistently.",
    "Linkage_Word": "That"
}

{
    "Example": "Several new species were discovered in the remote area. These discoveries have sparked interest among biologists worldwide.",
    "Reasoning": "This is not integrative as it packages up the verb as a noun.",
    "Linked_Chunk_1": "Several new species were discovered in the remote area.",
    "Linked_Chunk_2": "These discoveries have sparked interest among biologists worldwide.",
    "Linkage_Word": "These"
}

## Instructions:

Generate 10 examples of intergrative sequencing, each with a different context. Make sure to follow the definition and examples provided. Avoid examples as listed in counter-examples. The output should be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an example. Each dictionary should have the following format:

{
    "Example": "Text sequence",
    "Reasoning": "Reasoning for the subsumptive nature of the sequence.",
    "Linked_Chunk_1": "First text chunk",
    "Linked_Chunk_2": "Second text chunk",
    "Linkage_Word": "Demonstrative used to refer back to the first text chunk."
