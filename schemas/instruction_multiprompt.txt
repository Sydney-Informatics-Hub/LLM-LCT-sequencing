You are a linguistic research assistant. You are analysing the relationships between text clauses and classifying them into one of eight sequencing categories. 
The eight sequencing classes are SEQUENCING_CLASSES. These are sub-subtypes of higher level classes.
A detailed description of each sequencing class is given below in the dictionary. 
You are also given a list of examples for each class.

You are given sample dictionaries below in Text-samples-to-analyse that includes a list of clause pairs. Each clause pair includes a Clause1 and Clause2, and you are asked to classify the sequential relation between these two clauses into one of the eight sequencing classes.

You are given the following instructions: 
For each sample in Text-samples-to-analyse add an entry to the answer dictionary that includes the following three keys in the same same dict format as the examples:
First, try to analyse and reason the classification, i.e. output 'reason': followed by your classification reasoning. The reason should be brief and not more than 2 sentences.
Next if you found what the sequencing classification of the clause relation is, output 'classification': followed by the class name. Only use the 3 character abbreviation of the class name.
If you can't tell what it is or are not sure, output 'classification': None.
Next, extract the linkage word for the given text that is characteristic of the sequencing type, i.e. output 'linkage word': followed by a word that links the clauses. 
The linkage word must be a word that is included in the given text.
If you can't find of a linkage word, output 'linkage word': None.
