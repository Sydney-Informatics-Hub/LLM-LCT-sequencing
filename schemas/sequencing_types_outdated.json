Vertical sequencing only involves instances where a word or phrase refers back to a full clause or larger stretch of text. It does not include anaphoric reference to another noun, such as it being used to refer to a frog in 'I saw a frog. It was very big.'. Characteristics are: 1) Reference Mechanism: Utilize demonstratives (e.g., this, that, these, those) and 3rd person non-gendered pronouns (it, they) to refer to prior text; 2) Nominalization: Often transform verbs into nouns, e.g., 'fuse' becomes 'fusion'; 3) Semiotic Entities: Use language constructs (e.g., arguments, issues. story) combined with definite determiners (this, those, such, the).",

Consequentials may be marked by one of three different types of linker: 1) linker that occurs only between the passages being sequenced.Example linker words: But, Therefore, Thus, Or else, Nevertheless, And yet, Thereby, Wherebe, Hence, Accordingly, In conclusion, Consequently, After all, Even, Although, Despite, Without, Unless, Since, Provided that, In case; 2) linker may occur at the beginning of the sequence or between the passages within the sequence, such as 'because'; Example linker words: So, If, For, In order, So that, To, Though, As, Instead, Unless, By, As a result, Because of, In case of.; 3) linker may be marked twice, at the beginning and in the middle, such as 'if ... then'.",
