Okay everybody. Ssh! As you’ve noticed, our research team is here to film us. There’s a camera at the back of the room and there’s one at the front of the room and I’m wearing a microphone, okay? Just pretend like they’re not there. They’re going to be filming us over the next 6 to 8 lessons, so for the next two weeks or so, okay? Don’t want to see anyone being ridiculous in terms of waving at the camera, carrying on, okay? When we do get up to do our practical stuff, you have to stay away from both of the cameras, okay? I don’t want to see anybody even pretending to be silly near the cameras, okay? They are expensive pieces of equipment and if you damage it, you are responsible for it. Does everybody understand?
Good. All right. I can see two empty chairs today. Nikita, who’s at his guitar lesson and who?
Lucas. Oh, Nikita is away, Lucas has got music. Okay. Nikita.
Okay. The last time I saw you guys, we were finishing off the models of the solar system and then you guys had a little research task to complete a timeline about probes and space exploration and what we discovered about those things. I’ve had a little look to see who’s uploaded what onto Moodle. I haven’t looked through the files just yet but we’re not going to talk about that today. We’ll talk about those in the next few lessons, but for today we’re going to be conducting a prac and in that prac we’re gong to be working with some lamps and some thermometers and things. Yep?
I didn’t get the Moodle whatever that was.
